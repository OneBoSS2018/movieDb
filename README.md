When you start the application, a list of popular movies with pagination should be displayed
or dynamic loading (optional). Also on the page there should be a field for
search. When you enter a text there, the movies that appear to it should be displayed
meet. For each film, a list of genres should be displayed in the list
(names of genres, not idiots) to which it belongs.

When you click on the movie card, a page with detailed information should be displayed
about this film and a list of recommended (similar) films to it.

Also implement the ability to add movies to favorites both from the list and on the page with
a separate film. Save the list of such movies locally (localStorage,
example). Predict the list of selected movies somewhere in the application and
delete from favorites. Also provide a display on the card with the movie and him
information page that this movie has been added to favorites.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
